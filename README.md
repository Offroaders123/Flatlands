A cross platform 2D game built in the browser!

Flatlands is a lightweight JavaScript canvas game I have been working on every few weeks or so. I started it around May of 2020, and I came back to the project in mid 2021.

Flatlands supports most input methods, so you have the ability to play using a keyboard, a controller, or a touch screen with Flatlands' on-screen D-pad controls.

It is also a complete PWA, including all-offline play, and the option to install to your device as an app with an icon, and use in a separate window.
